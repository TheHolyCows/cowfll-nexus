# Audio Files for Match Timer

Place the following audio files in this directory for timer sound effects:

- `start.mp3` - Plays when the match starts (at 2:29)
- `warning.mp3` - Plays at 30 seconds remaining
- `stop.mp3` - Plays when time expires (at 0:00)

## Notes

- The system will work without audio files by using generated beep sounds as fallback
- Recommended format: MP3 or OGG
- Keep files short (1-3 seconds) for best experience
- Make sure audio files are not too loud

## Finding Audio Files

You can:
1. Copy from the old CowFLLTM system (`old_cowflltm/CowFLLTM/public/sounds/`)
2. Use free sound effects from sites like freesound.org
3. Generate simple beeps using audio software

## Example Sources

- Start bell: A pleasant bell or chime sound (800 Hz beep as fallback)
- Warning: An alert tone or warning beep (600 Hz beep as fallback)
- Stop: A buzzer or horn sound (400 Hz beep as fallback)
